React things we're learning:
- class component
- virtual DOM

```bash
npx create-react-app dino-blog
cd dino-blog
npm start
```

might need to change the start script in the package.json if you get error on server run

for some reason npx isn't working or updating to a newer version so I used yarn package manager

```bash
yarn create react-app dino-blog
```
